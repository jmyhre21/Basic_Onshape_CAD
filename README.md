## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment is the mount and it is a 120mm x 120mm rectangle, has four 10mm holes in the corners 20mm away from each side, and a 25mm circle in the middle of the rectangle.
### Evidence

### Reflection
This was a fairly easy part and I liked that you didn't have to make each on individually

## Fork

### Description
Sketch a circle 80mm in diameter, and extrude it 8mm thick.Then sketch the following on the cylinders face, and extrude it 75mm. Once you've extruded the fork's first arm, we need to soften it with 3 different filets.  Filets will round out edges for you.  The first one is a pair of 15mm filets. Next, a 1mm filet on the front and back edges. Use the mirror feature, and find a plane to reflect your arm and it's filets.

### Reflection
This was one of the hardest parts that we have done so far because it had so many components. We had to use a lot more features than all of the last ones.

## Tire

### Description
For the tire you have to make a trapazoid that is 20mm wide and 80/110 from the midpint and the you had to revlve it around the axis and then put campfer on it.

### Reflection
This was an easy part to make as I get better at Onshape and more comphortable because there were not many things to do.

## Wheel

### Description
For the wheel you had to make three rectangles symetrical and the top one is 20mm, the middle one is 50 tall, 5 wide, and the last one is 15mm taall 20mm wide. Then you had to revovle it around to look like the rim of the wheel, then you had to make 5 cut outs in the wheel and then put a campfer on it.

### Reflection
This was probably the hardest one yet because it had so many contraints and differernt tools we had to use.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
FOr this part/parts we had to make a rod with a cap kind of on the end and then make a cut where the cap would go and then put a hole through that. And for the bearing you had to just make a big ring, nothing else.
### Evidence

### Reflection
This one was fairly easy but the one tricky thing for me was cutting out that little peice under the collar, other than that it was a breeze.
