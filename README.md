# Basic_Onshape_CAD
# Hello Onshape
## What I learned
- pause in between steps
- go back if you're stuck
### Base
[base](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/ce773a82bd964b97c2ca363a/w/c0f01d6acc032f33e236332b/e/3a7ee1ac464f60314d4e3d94)
The base was kind of hard for me because it was the first time using ONSHAPE, but i figured it out just by watching the videos a couple times and pausing in between steps.

### Mount

This one was a lot easier because it was basically the same as the base but with less holes and a smaller rectangle.

### Fork
[fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/cafb874cd033d399e180c367/w/ccf1fd05031f1a0b46999864/e/cbc5db12bd25112ae0a95b9d)
For the fork I made a circle and two things coming out of it, this is the first time I used the fillet feature and the mirror feature. The fillets made it look a lot cleaner and the mirror was very time saveing. I had some trouble figuring out hoe to center the things sticking out on the circle but I got it after re watching the video.
### Tire
[tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/d43e7af70bb7225a9f9300f9/w/f8d8dece1e6f55a921219120/e/dbe68bc4b8b4f6f6502cd653)
For the tire this I had to make a rectangle and then revolve it, the revolve is a very cool feature on onshape. I also had to put fillets on the edne of the tire to make it look more like a tire, then I changed the color and was done. I didn't have any challenges with this part.
### Wheel
[wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/782790b432309b8bf32051a3/w/a3671807251b084d60fcfda5/e/5c28fd3a1ab9fca542346eab)
The wheel was kind of challenging for me, the dimensions kept on getting tangled I guess and I just had to go back and do it differently until I got it. I had to make three rectangles and revolve them and then make spokes in a circular pattern then add some fillets.
### Axle, Collar Bearings
[Axle, Collar, Bearings](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/318a6b7d0bf89a3a1e42aae0/w/aab806db89c28408d1605123/e/4615d72c36bf873a6cc29539)
For this I had to make a circle and extrude it then make cut then the collar and the bearing. I had a little bit of trouble with the the bearing cut but then i got it after re-watching the video.
### Pre-assembly

For the pre assembly it was pretty easy because of the onshape fundemental assembly really made it easy to get used to putting parts together, I had to put togeth the wheel, tire, axle, and bearngs.
### Final

For the final assembly I had to put all the parts together that we have made, some of the parts took some fidgeting with to get in the right spot but it did not take very long. I liked how it turned out and it was very helpful to already have the screws pre made.
