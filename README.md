# Basic_Onshape_CAD
# Hello Onshape
## What I learned
- pause in between steps
- go back if you're stuck
### Base
[base](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/ce773a82bd964b97c2ca363a/w/c0f01d6acc032f33e236332b/e/3a7ee1ac464f60314d4e3d94)
The base was kind of hard for me because it was the first time using ONSHAPE, but i figured it out just by watching the videos a couple times and pausing in between steps.

### Mount

This one was a lot easier because it was basically the same as the base but with less holes and a smaller rectangle.

### Fork
[fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/cafb874cd033d399e180c367/w/ccf1fd05031f1a0b46999864/e/cbc5db12bd25112ae0a95b9d)
For the fork I made a circle and two things coming out of it, this is the first time I used the fillet feature and the mirror feature. The fillets made it look a lot cleaner and the mirror was very time saveing. I had some trouble figuring out hoe to center the things sticking out on the circle but I got it after re watching the video.
### Tire
[tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/d43e7af70bb7225a9f9300f9/w/f8d8dece1e6f55a921219120/e/dbe68bc4b8b4f6f6502cd653)
For the tire this I had to make a rectangle and then revolve it, the revolve is a very cool feature on onshape. I also had to put fillets on the edne of the tire to make it look more like a tire, then I changed the color and was done. I didn't have any challenges with this part.
### Wheel
[wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/782790b432309b8bf32051a3/w/a3671807251b084d60fcfda5/e/5c28fd3a1ab9fca542346eab)
The wheel was kind of challenging for me, the dimensions kept on getting tangled I guess and I just had to go back and do it differently until I got it. I had to make three rectangles and revolve them and then make spokes in a circular pattern then add some fillets.
### Axle, Collar Bearings
[Axle, Collar, Bearings](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/318a6b7d0bf89a3a1e42aae0/w/aab806db89c28408d1605123/e/4615d72c36bf873a6cc29539)
For this I had to make a circle and extrude it then make cut then the collar and the bearing. I had a little bit of trouble with the the bearing cut but then i got it after re-watching the video.
